			I'm Sara Hosseini, a soon to be 1st Year Software Engineer Student at University of Waterloo, who has a strong passion
			for art and coding. I love to carry my sketchbook and graphic tablet wherever I go. I also enjoy user interface design,
			mobile game development, character design, web development and much more. Although there are more things that need
			to be done on this website, feel free to look around!
